# sgfAutoParser

This sgfAutoParser takes *.sgf files as input and generates several *.npz files. The contents of these *.npz files are 4096*7*19*19 numpy.array and 4096*361 numpy.array. There is also a demo for Deep Learning with the help of [Keras](https://keras.io/) and [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/).

## Setup

### Clone

```
git clone {{Git address of this repository (you can find it by clicking the green "Clone or Download" button)}}
```

### Install Keras and Tensorflow

You should first install [Tensorflow Installation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/g3doc/get_started/os_setup.md). I recommend Virtualenv install. Then install [Keras Installation](https://keras.io/).

### One more thing

The code in this project runs on Python 3 and numpy. Please make sure you have got them.
